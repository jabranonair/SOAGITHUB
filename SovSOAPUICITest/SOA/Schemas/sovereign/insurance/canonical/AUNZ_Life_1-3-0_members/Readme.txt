FYI - Microsoft Security Update - HTML Help Modification (June 2005)

A recent security update from Microsoft modifies the HTML Help OCX used to display HTML files.

Only content on the "local machine" can be displayed. If you keep the ACORD XML Help file(s) on your server and access them via a UNC pathname, after installing the latest Windows Update, you will no longer able to view ACORD XML help file content in files on your server. If you copy the file(s) to your local drive you can view them correctly.

The following Microsoft knowledge base article describes this security update and possible workarounds for it:

http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;892675


FYI #2 - Microsoft Security Update - HTML Help Modification (Nov 2005)

You may not be able to open the Help File after being downloaded and on the local drive. This is another MS security feature where the ACORD site is not a trusted site. The user will get a message upon opening the Help file that it is from an untrusted source and asks whether it should continue to open. Selecting "Yes" does no good, as the user will get a "File not found". Instead you have to open the properties window on the help file, and you will see a new button as shown in the attached image. Use the Unlock button to unlock the file, the warning message should go away and the file open with no problem.


FYI #3 - Hyperlinks do not function following download and unzip

- Go to the folder containing the Help file. 
- Right-click on the Help file and select properties. 
- From the "Properties" window click the "unblock" button. 
- The "unblock" button will only appear for those users experiencing a problem.

FYI #4 - Help File not displaying in Windows 7

On computers that are running Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2008 R2, you may be unable to open Help files that require the Windows Help (WinHlp32.exe) program 

Microsoft stopped including the 32-bit Help file viewer in Windows releases beginning with Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. To support customers who still rely on legacy files, the Microsoft Download Center provides WinHlp32.exe downloads for Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2.


Special note for Help content providers who ship files

Starting with the release of Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, third-party software developers are no longer authorized to redistribute WinHlp32.exe with their programs. For more information.

FYI #5 - Help File not displaying in Windows 7

If you get a Security Warning on the Open File action, UNTICK the box at the bottom of the dialog box that states "Always ask before opening this file".



Modularized Schemas
-------------------

Schemas in ACORD XML have been modularized to help with maintenance.  The files that are "common" now exist in a directory called ACORDSchemaWSDL.  Under this directory, there are four additional directories which contain schema sections as dictated by the Naming And Design Rules (NDR).

The first directory is called codelists. This directory contains seven schemas.  The two that begin with "ACORD_CodeLists" contain all ACORD owned codelists and their enumerations.  The schemas that begin with ACORD_CodeLists_ClosedEnum contain non enumerated ACORD codelists.  The schemas with the "_Doc" suffix contain documentation for the respective code lists and values.  Additionally, ACORD is now providing three codelists not owned by ACORD that contain freely available MIME types, country codes and currency codes.

The second directory is called data.  This directory contains 4 schemas.  BusinessDataAggregates contains all aggregates that have some type of business meaning, for instance AccidentItemSection or AccidentSection.  BusinessDataTypes contains all tags that have a business meaning, for instance WatercraftEquipmentTypeCode or WatercraftCoverageOptionCode.  CommonMessageAggregates  and ReusableDataComponents are not used at this time.

The third directory is called messages.  This directory contains one schema for all Southern Africa transcations.

Finally, the fourth directory is called WSDL Components.  It contains the WSDL file.

For validation purposes, your XML stream only needs to contain the schema located in the messages directory.
